# C++ Console Minigames
This is a collection of console games I've made.

## GuessTheNumber
A simple game where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number (with option to be told whether one is getting closer or not).

## Hangman
Much like the game Hangman without the visual. Words can be saved into a file for reuse.

## HeadsOrTails
Heads or Tails (guess whether heads or tails), but with up to six players. The first player to a chosen score wins.

## MemoryGame
A game where the player tries to memorize sets of numbers until they get one wrong (the set of numbers increases after each round).

## RaceToFillTheBank
A game where up to six players compete to reach 20 points within their "bank" before any other player. Players get points by rolling a dice (0-4), and they can choose to keep rolling until they get a 0, at which point they bust, or they can save their points from that round. It's a game of risk vs. reward where players don't want to play too risky to where they lose their points but need to be the first to save 20 points.

## Tic-Tac-Toe
Just like the original Tic-Tac-Toe, but in the console.

## WheelOfForunte
A game where players try to guess letters in a phrase, and eventually guess the entire phrase, to win the most amount of money of their competitors.
